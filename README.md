# ASN Threat Feed
Generates a threat feed IP list from a user-furnished Autonomous System Number(ASN) list.  The output can then be consumed by firewalls and filtering tools.  Inspired by https://github.com/X4BNet/lists_vpn, but written to use a different source database due to deficiencies discovered with the iptoasn data.  When malicious traffic is observed from a datacenter or undesired source/location, blocking inbound traffic from an entire ASN can help reduce alert fatigue and bolster defences.

## Prerequisites
1. IP2Location Lite database subscription (sign up at https://lite.ip2location.com/ip2location-lite).
2. A list of one or more ASNs you wish to have converted to an IP list.  I highly recommend ASNLookup https://asnlookup.com to find an associated AS number for observed suspect or malicious activity.

## Running
### Input files
   - ASN.txt : list of AS numbers in format ASn[n..] to add to the block list, one entry per line, comments permitted with a "#" followed by text.  See the repo ASN.txt file for examples.  
   - IPBlockExceptions.txt : Specific ASN IP ranges to never block (MUST exactly match an entry in the ASN database), one CIDR per line.  

### For Linux/Bash
   - buildasn.sh : Downloads a fresh copy of the ASN IP database and rebuilds the BlockASNs.txt list. This should only be run once per month, as the IP2Location Lite database is released monthly on/around the 1st of each month.  
   - updateasn.sh : Regenerates the BlockASNs.txt list using the pre-existing copy of the ASN IP database.  

### For Windows/PowerShell
   - buildasn.ps1 : Downloads a fresh copy of the ASN IP database and rebuilds the BlockASNs.txt list. This should only be run once per month, as the IP2Location Lite database is released monthly on/around the 1st of each month.  
   - updateasn.ps1 : Regenerates the BlockASNs.txt list using the pre-existing copy of the ASN IP database.  

### Output
   - BlockedASNs.txt (PowerShell version will automatically move the output file to a specified web folder for pickup)
